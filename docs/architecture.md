# Harness Platform Architecture

> Last updated: 2026-05-25

## Overview

Harness Platform runs one AI data-analysis agent per gVisor sandbox session. The orchestrator owns session state, starts per-generation sandboxes, routes user turns through the Agent Bridge claim/ack protocol, persists durable turn and event records, correlates model proxy requests, and publishes events to the frontend.

The current baseline uses:

- gVisor `runsc` with the `systrap` platform.
- Per-generation OCI specs, bundles, control manifests, bridge dirs, and network profiles under `harness.run_dir`.
- Long-lived active runtime generations while the conversation is active.
- Checkpoint/restore primitives behind the Phase 7 control plane, with automatic idle checkpointing disabled by the checked-in policy.
- Same-origin Server-Sent Events for the browser event path.
- Durable `events` table replay for multi-turn output routing.
- Bridge-backed Claude and shell sessions with interrupt support.
- Explicit local Claude proxy configuration loaded from `config/harness.yaml`.

The checkpoint-safe architecture is tracked in [phase7/README.md](./phase7/README.md).

## Component Model

        gVisor sandbox
          |-- harness-agent-entrypoint
          |-- harness-bridge-client
          |-- Claude Code / PTY-backed shell agent
          |-- /workspace exact bind -> verified session workspace
          `-- /agent-home exact bind -> verified session+driver home
```

Phase 8 runtime rendering forbids parent `/sessions` and `/agent-homes` mounts.
Generation launch receives verified DataVolume paths from the control plane and
renders exact binds for only the current `/workspace` and selected
`/agent-home`.

The frontend talks to its own origin. Route handlers forward API calls to the orchestrator, including the SSE stream:

```text
GET /api/events/stream -> orchestrator GET /api/events/stream
```

The orchestrator still exposes `/api/events` as a WebSocket endpoint for compatibility and manual debugging.

## Session State Machine

```text
created
  -> running_active
  -> running_idle

Any active state can fail or be destroyed.
```

The canonical session status set is:

```text
created
running_active
running_idle
checkpointing
checkpointed
failed
destroyed
```

State meanings:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `created` | Session exists but no sandbox has been started for it yet. |
| `running_active` | A user turn is being processed. |
| `running_idle` | The container is still alive and ready for another turn. |
| `checkpointing` | Legacy/experimental busy state for a checkpoint in progress. Startup reconciliation recovers stale rows. |
| `checkpointed` | A generation has a persisted checkpoint and reserved allocation identity. The next accepted turn claims it for restore, validates metadata, recreates resources, and requires a bridge probe before claiming work. Legacy pre-Phase-7 checkpoint rows are fenced by migration as unrestorable. |
| `failed` | Runtime or parser error. |
| `destroyed` | User or API explicitly ended the session. |

Input is accepted only in `created`, `running_idle`, and `checkpointed`. `running_active` and `checkpointing` are busy states. `failed` and `destroyed` are terminal states. The older `running`, `idle`, and `completed` names are not part of the current schema or API contract.

## Runtime Flow

`Runtime.Start()` chooses one of three paths:

1. **Live path**: if the session has an active live generation, enqueue the turn and let the bridge claim it.
2. **Restore path**: if the session is `checkpointed`, claim the checkpointed generation for restore, recreate compatible resources, validate checkpoint metadata, run `runsc restore`, and require the bridge probe before claim.
3. **Cold path**: allocate a new runtime generation, render per-generation resources, run the host-side proxy probe, start `runsc`, require the in-sandbox bridge probe, then let the bridge claim turns.

The active Go runtime now drives `runsc` directly. `bundle/bake-bundle.sh` and
`bundle/restore-sandbox.sh` are quarantined legacy Phase 2 smoke tools: they
fail closed and are not Phase 8 release evidence.

The bridge is the lower-level turn transport. It uses a file-backed queue so reconnect and checkpoint/restore do not depend on a live host pipe.

## Output Routing

Each container has its own pub/sub hub:

```go
type OutputEvent struct {
    Stream string // stdout, stderr, runtime
    Line   string
}

type Container struct {
    SessionID string
    RestoreID string
    Agent     string
    Stdin     io.WriteCloser
    OutputHub *OutputHub
}
```

Scanner goroutines publish container stdout and stderr lines into `OutputHub`. A `runSession()` call subscribes only for its current turn. This is the key change that fixed the old multi-turn callback bug.

Publishing is non-blocking. A slow subscriber may drop output lines instead of blocking the container scanner.

## Turn Completion

For Claude Code, user turns are written as one JSONL frame because the sandbox entrypoint launches Claude with `--input-format stream-json`:

```json
{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
```

The stream parser marks a turn complete when it sees:

- `{"type":"result","subtype":"success",...}`
- `{"type":"error",...}`
- a non-success result subtype, which is reported as turn output while the session returns to `running_idle`

For shell sessions, the `harness-shell-agent` shim runs a PTY-backed shell and emits `harness.shell_output` frames for command output plus `harness.turn_done` when the prompt returns. The orchestrator persists shell output as assistant text, publishes it as `agent.output`, and exposes `POST /api/sessions/{id}/interrupt` for the running turn.

For future agent adapters, the bridge remains the session-level transport. Each adapter still needs its own completion/output contract before it is a first-class multi-turn citizen.

## Event Model

Runtime output becomes higher-level events:

| Source | Parser behavior | Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime` stream | lifecycle/status line | `system.status` |
| `stderr` | debug/log output | `agent.output` |
| Claude `stream_event` text delta | append to pending assistant text | `agent.delta` |
| Claude `assistant` message | persist final assistant text | `agent.message` |
| Claude `result` with text | persist result if not duplicate | `agent.message` |
| Shell `harness.shell_output` | publish shell output and persist assistant text | `agent.output` / `agent.message` |
| Shell `harness.turn_done` | mark the shell turn complete | completion |
| Plain stdout | persist as assistant text | `agent.message` |
| Artifact watcher | file create/write metadata | `artifact.updated` |
| Artifact watcher | file/directory remove or rename metadata cleanup | `artifact.deleted` |

The frontend keeps an SSE connection open and also polls session/messages/artifacts after sending a message to recover from transient stream issues.

## API Surface

HTTP:

- `GET /healthz`
- `POST /api/login`
- `GET /api/sessions`
- `POST /api/sessions`
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}`
- `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}`
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}/messages`
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/messages`
- `POST /api/sessions/{id}/interrupt`
- `GET /api/sessions/{id}/artifacts`
- `GET /artifacts/{session_id}/{path}`

Phase 7 adds:

- `GET /api/quota`
- JSON envelope `{"error_class":"...","error":"..."}` for typed runtime/control-plane failures such as pool exhaustion or probe failure. Generic validation and not-found handlers may still return `{"error":"..."}`.

Events:

- `GET /api/events/stream?session_id=<id>` - SSE
- `GET /api/events?session_id=<id>` - WebSocket compatibility

Session lifecycle event names use the canonical status values:

- `session.created`
- `session.running_active`
- `session.running_idle`
- `session.checkpointing`
- `session.checkpointed`
- `session.failed`
- `session.destroyed`
- `artifact.updated`
- `artifact.deleted`

## Artifact Browser

Artifact metadata is still persisted as a flat SQLite list keyed by session and path. The frontend derives a live file tree from that list, so the API stays simple while users get a folder-oriented browser with search, tabs, file sizes, update times, and per-file download actions.

Artifact serving is intentionally read-only and constrained to regular files under the session workspace. Download requests reject path traversal, symlink components, symlink escape, directories, and non-regular files. The watcher also skips symlink artifacts during scans.

The artifact watcher publishes:

- `artifact.updated` for create/write metadata upserts.
- `artifact.deleted` for remove/rename cleanup, including directory-prefix metadata deletion.

The current preview set covers Markdown, code, text, images, JSON, CSV/TSV, and PDF. Unknown binary files remain downloadable but are not rendered inline.

## Configuration

Orchestrator:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HARNESS_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDR` | `:8090` | HTTP bind address |
| `HARNESS_LAB_PASSWORD` | empty | Enables shared-password auth when set |
| `HARNESS_COOKIE_NAME` | `harness_auth` | Auth cookie name |
| `HARNESS_SESSION_RETENTION` | `harness.session_retention` (`0s`) | Session/history retention horizon; `0s` disables automatic expiry |
| `HARNESS_REPO_ROOT` | repo root | Repository root used to derive bundle paths |
| `HARNESS_SESSIONS_ROOT` | `/var/lib/harness/sessions` | Host workspace root |
| `HARNESS_AGENT_HOMES_ROOT` | `/var/lib/harness/agent-homes` | Host root for per-session agent HOME state, mounted outside `/workspace` |
| `HARNESS_CHECKPOINTS_ROOT` | `/var/lib/harness/checkpoints` | Checkpoint image root |
| `HARNESS_BUNDLE_ROOT` | `<repo>/bundle/out` | OCI bundle root |
| `HARNESS_DB_PATH` | `/var/lib/harness/state/orchestrator.db` | SQLite DB path, outside sandbox-bindable roots |
| `HARNESS_DEFAULT_AGENT` | `claude` | Default session agent |
| `HARNESS_MAX_SESSIONS` | `harness.max_sessions` (`30`) | Non-terminal session ceiling; independent of live `/30` capacity |
| `RUNSC_ROOT` | `/var/lib/harness/runsc` | runsc state root |

`HARNESS_RESTORE_SCRIPT` is still parsed by config for compatibility, but the current direct `runsc` path does not execute the script.

Project config:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config/harness.yaml` | Phase 7 typed control-plane schema and explicit lab runtime profile. |

The config loader reads `config/harness.yaml` through a strict `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` decoder. The primary shape is the Phase 7 `harness:` schema: `run_dir`, `session_retention`, `max_sessions`, nested network egress, event retention, probe status, bridge lease, and reaper settings are decoded into typed config and validated before startup. Legacy sandbox secret keys are rejected. Legacy files containing only top-level `runtime:` / `claude:` sections still load for compatibility, but mixing legacy sections with `harness:` is rejected.

General orchestrator paths such as session roots and DB path still use the environment variables above. `HARNESS_SESSION_RETENTION` and `HARNESS_MAX_SESSIONS` override their `harness:` values and are revalidated against the Phase 7 schema. `HARNESS_SESSION_TTL` is obsolete and fails startup if present so deployments do not silently switch to no-expiry retention.

With `session_retention: 0s`, sessions, messages, artifacts, workspaces, and agent-home paths do not expire automatically. `harness.max_sessions` still counts non-terminal sessions (`created`, `running_active`, `running_idle`, `checkpointing`, `checkpointed`) rather than live gVisor resources, so it is not validated against the configured `/30` pool. `GET /api/quota` reports `soft_session_ceiling` and `live_pool_ceiling` separately. Operators should close sessions explicitly with `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` to free session quota; close preserves history and workspace state while reclaiming runtime resources.

Current `config/harness.yaml` values:

```yaml
harness:
  run_dir: /var/lib/harness/run
  session_retention: 0s
  max_sessions: 30

    idle_threshold: 30m
    monitor_interval: 5m
  reaper:
    failed_retention: 10m
    checkpoint_image_retention: 720h
```

Claude control manifest:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `proxy_bind_url` | Explicit host bind URL for the local proxy, `http://0.0.0.0:8082` |
| `anthropic_base_url` | Sandbox-visible stable proxy alias, `http://harness-model-proxy.internal:8082` |
| provider credentials | Absent from sandbox control files; upstream credentials stay host/proxy-side and model requests are authorized through source-IP/generation/turn context plus driver entitlement |
| `claude_model` | Claude model alias, default `sonnet` |
| `claude_code_disable_nonessential_traffic` | Keep Claude Code from making nonessential traffic during sandbox turns |
| `session_workspace` | In-container workspace mount, `/workspace` |
| `harness_agent_home` | In-container agent home mount, `/agent-home` |

Frontend:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HARNESS_API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8090` | Server-side proxy target |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` | fallback alias | Server-side proxy target |
| `PORT` | Next.js default unless set | Local frontend port; use `8000` in docs |

## Network Model

The target security model remains gVisor sandbox networking plus host-side egress controls for Doris and the local LLM proxy.

The current Go runtime launches `runsc` with `-network sandbox -overlay2 none`. The allocator persists a generation-specific netns/veth pair, `/30`, gateway, proxy URL, and egress policy; the runtime recreates those host resources before start/restore, runs a host-side netns probe against the local proxy, and renders the generation's netns path into the OCI spec. The host proxy bind URL remains `http://0.0.0.0:8082`, and the lab proxy key remains `123`.

## Checkpointing

`MonitorIdleSessions()` performs startup reconciliation and then obeys the checkpoint policy. The checked-in lab config has `harness.checkpoint.auto_enabled: false`, so automatic checkpointing is disabled by policy, not because the turn transport is still stdin-coupled.

The checkpoint code still exists for experiments:

```text
running_idle -> checkpointing -> checkpointed
```

`Runtime.Checkpoint()` writes a checkpoint image manifest and persists the runtime artifact digests needed for restore validation. On failure the generation returns to `running_idle`, so a later idle pass can retry if policy permits it.

The Phase 7 path is:

```text
durable turn ledger
  -> runtime generation idle
  -> checkpoint generation
  -> restore generation
  -> reconnect agent bridge
  -> claim next turn
```

Checkpoint/restore remains policy-gated. Operators should enable automatic checkpointing only after restore behavior, resource retention, and SLOs are acceptable for the target deployment.

## Current Limitations

- Phase 8 is still not release-complete until destructive cutover, proxy
  contract re-pin evidence, host reconciliation evidence, and all adversarial
  gates pass on the target lab host.
- Legacy session `workspace`, `agent_home_path`, and `restore_id` columns remain
  internal compatibility storage. Public DTOs omit them, and runtime launch uses
  verified DataVolume rows instead.
- Additional agent adapters beyond Claude Code and the shell shim need their own completion contract before they are first-class multi-turn citizens.
- Artifact browsing is read-only. File creation, renaming, and deletion should still happen through the sandbox agent or shell session, with the UI reflecting those changes through metadata events.
- Tenant-level resource limits and production egress policy management are Phase 10 work.
- The current output hub intentionally drops lines for slow subscribers; that is acceptable for UI logs but should be revisited before using the stream as an audit log.
- Automatic checkpoint/restore is not enabled by default in the lab config; it is a policy decision on top of the Phase 7 control plane.
